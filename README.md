# Multiplex-Management-System
This project involves the development of a robust database management system for multiplex management using PL/SQL. The system is designed to handle various operations efficiently and ensure seamless data retrieval and manipulation.

### Key Contributions
- **PL/SQL Development**:

    -  ***Functions, Procedures, and Triggers***: Implemented various PL/SQL functions, procedures, and triggers to perform complex operations for multiplex management. These operations include ticket bookings, show scheduling, customer management, and more.
    -  ***Real-Time Operations***: Ensured that all operations are performed efficiently and effectively at any given time, providing real-time updates to the system.
- **Database Design and Optimization**:

   -  ***Schema Design***: Developed robust database schemas that are optimized for performance and scalability. The schema design supports various multiplex operations, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
   -  ***Query Optimization***: Created efficient SQL queries for easy and quick data retrieval and manipulation, enhancing the overall performance of the system.
   -  ***ER Diagrams***: Designed Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to visualize and plan the database structure, defining the relationships between different entities within the multiplex management system. This helped in creating a well-organized and efficient database schema.
   -  ***Normalization***: Applied normalization techniques to the database design to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. This included normalizing tables to at least the third normal form (3NF), which optimized the database structure for efficient data storage and retrieval.
